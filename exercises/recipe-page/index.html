            Think chocolate almond croissant, but ten times easier. Buttery, 
            fluffy rolls filled with creamy almond goodness and melty 
            chocolate, then topped with toasty almonds for that golden crunch. 
            They taste like they came straight from a bakery—except you made 
            them in under an hour.

            <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>    
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking dish or 
                sheet tray with parchment paper.
            </li>
            
            <h4>MAKE THE ALMOND SIMPLE SYRUP:</h4>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan, combine water, sugar, and almond extract. 
                Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar fully dissolves. 
                Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
            </li>
            
            <h4>MAKE THE ALMOND FILLING:</h4>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, add almond flour, granulated sugar, a pinch 
                of salt, unsalted butter, one egg, vanilla extract, and almond 
                extract. Beat everything together until smooth and creamy. 
                Reserve about ¼ cup of the filling to use for dolloping on 
                top later.
            </li>
            
            <h4>PREPARE AND BAKE THE ROLLS:</h4>

            <li>
                Without pulling them apart, slice the entire pack of King’s 
                Hawaiian rolls in half horizontally like a sandwich. Place the 
                bottom half in your prepared dish.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Brush the inside of both the bottom and top halves 
                (cut sides only) with the almond simple syrup.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Spread the majority of the almond filling evenly over the 
                bottom half of the rolls. Sprinkle chocolate chips or chopped
                chocolate all over the filling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place the top half of the rolls back on. Spoon little dollops 
                of the reserved almond filling across the top of the rolls. 
                Press sliced almonds into the filling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake uncovered for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the tops are 
                golden and the filling on top is set and slightly crisped.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Let cool slightly, dust with powdered sugar, and pull apart 
                to serve warm and gooey!
            </li>
        </ol>
