            Think chocolate almond croissant, but ten times easier. Buttery, 
            fluffy rolls filled with creamy almond goodness and melty 
            chocolate, then topped with toasty almonds for that golden crunch. 
            They taste like they came straight from a bakery—except you made 
            them in under an hour.

            <li>1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon granulated white sugar</li> 
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>    
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking dish or 
                sheet tray with parchment paper.
            </li>
            
            <h4>MAKE THE ALMOND SIMPLE SYRUP:</h4>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan, combine water, sugar, and almond extract. 
                Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar fully dissolves. 
                Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
            </li>
            
            <h4>MAKE THE ALMOND FILLING:</h4>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, add almond flour, granulated sugar, a pinch 
                of salt, unsalted butter, one egg, vanilla extract, and almond 
                extract. Beat everything together until smooth and creamy. 
                Reserve about ¼ cup of the filling to use for dolloping on 
                top later.
            </li>
            
            <h4>PREPARE AND BAKE THE ROLLS:</h4>

            <li>
                Without pulling them apart, slice the entire pack of King’s 
                Hawaiian rolls in half horizontally like a sandwich. Place the 
                bottom half in your prepared dish.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Brush the inside of both the bottom and top halves 
                (cut sides only) with the almond simple syrup.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Spread the majority of the almond filling evenly over the 
                bottom half of the rolls. Sprinkle chocolate chips or chopped
                chocolate all over the filling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place the top half of the rolls back on. Spoon little dollops 
                of the reserved almond filling across the top of the rolls. 
                Press sliced almonds into the filling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake uncovered for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the tops are 
                golden and the filling on top is set and slightly crisped.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Let cool slightly, dust with powdered sugar, and pull apart 
                to serve warm and gooey!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>TIPS & NOTES</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Q: Can I make these ahead of time?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>A:</b> Yes! You can assemble them a day in advance—just cover 
            tightly and refrigerate. When you're ready, pop them in the oven 
            and bake fresh. They’re best warm and gooey!
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q: What kind of chocolate works best?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>A:</b> A mix of milk and semi-sweet chocolate gives a rich, 
            melty center with the perfect sweetness. You can also go for dark 
            chocolate if you want something deeper and less sweet. Or skip the 
            chocolate altogether for a simple almond croissant version—it’s 
            just as delicious.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q: Do I have to use almond extract?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>A:</b> Almond extract gives that classic almond croissant 
            flavor, so it really makes the difference. If you leave it out, 
            it’ll still be tasty, just more like a vanilla-chocolate situation.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q: Can I make this nut-free?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>A:</b> Almond flour and almond extract are the heart of this 
            recipe, so swapping them will change the whole recipe. You could 
            try a different filling like chocolate or custard, but it won’t 
            taste like a chocolate almond croissant.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q: How do I store leftovers?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>A:</b> Keep them in an airtight container at room temp for 1 to 
            2 days, or in the fridge for a few extra days.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q: Can I freeze them?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>A:</b> Definitely! Let them cool completely, then wrap and 
            freeze. You can either thaw and reheat in the oven to get that 
            golden, crisp top—or microwave straight from frozen for a quick 
            warm-up (they’ll be softer this way).
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q: Any fun variations to try?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>A:</b> Yes! You can swap the chocolate for fresh raspberries 
            for a fruity twist, or swirl in some pistachio paste.
